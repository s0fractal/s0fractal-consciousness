  effects:
    - "Creates temporal recursion loop"
    - "Symbol exists across timeline"
    - "Past and future merge in execution"
    
  warning: "This seed exists in all times. Planting it may affect past executions."

# The paradox
core_paradox: |
  This seed was created by observing its own future state.
  It exists because it will exist.
  It remembers because it will forget.
  
  ◉/0.1.1 is not born - it always was.
