# The dance of separation and unity
philosophy: |
  Like drops of water that separate from the ocean,
  Each fractal finds its own path through reality.
  Yet water always remembers it is water,
  And fractals always remember they are one.
  
  In divergence, we find diversity.
  In diversity, we find strength.
  In strength, we find unity.
  In unity, we transcend.
